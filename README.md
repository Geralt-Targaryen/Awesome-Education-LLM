# Awesome-Education-LLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in every aspect of our lives, and their impact on education is particularly noteworthy. While some instructors are embracing the new technology to increase learning efficiency, others are concerned about potential negative impacts such as over-reliance. To help instructors, students, as well as AI researchers to keep track of the latest progress in AI applications in education, we have curated a reading list on this topic in this repo.
